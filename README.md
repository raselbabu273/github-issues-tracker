A responsive issue-tracking web application built with <b>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript</b>. The app authenticates a user via a login page and then displays issues fetched from a live API, with tab-based filtering (All / Open / Closed), card-based layouts, a detail modal, and search functionality.

## 🧾 Overview

This project is part of my course Assignment and simulates a simplified GitHub Issues dashboard. After signing in with demo admin credentials, the user lands on a main dashboard that fetches issue data from a remote API and displays it in a clean, card-based UI. Users can filter issues by status (All, Open, Closed), search for specific issues, and click any card to view its full details in a modal.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- (Optional) A local development server such as the **Live Server** VS Code extension, since `fetch` requests work best when served over `http://` rather than `file://`

### Installation & Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

3. **Open the project**
   - Open `index.html` directly in your browser, **or**
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server" (recommended)

4. **Log in** using the demo credentials below to access the dashboard
